## About KotOR.js

KotOR.js is a TypeScript-based reimplementation of the Odyssey Game Engine that powered the original Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR) and its sequel, KotOR II: The Sith Lords (TSL). The project aims to support the complete feature set of the original engine while providing modern tooling for modders through KotOR Forge.
